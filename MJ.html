              <td colspan="2"></br><p>Mahela Jayawardene, a masterful technician oozing class, has been the lynchpin of the Sri Lankan batting line-up for the last decade and more. He heralded a seamless transition to the new era of the Sri Lankan middle-order. Along with Kumaa Sangakarra, he ensured the absence of yesteryear greats, Aravinda de Silva and Arjuna Ranatunga was hardly felt. A prolific run-scorer, a shrewd thinker of the game and a sharp fielder, Jayawardene is one of the finest cricketers, the Island nation has produced. His achievements have been recognised by the international cricketing fraternity when in 2006, the ICC named him the Captain of the Year and the captain of the World ODI team of the year. In 2007, he was named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year.
Jayawardene made his debut in the historic 1997 Test match between India and Sri Lanka, in which the Lankans posted the highest-ever total in history of 952/6 declared. Being a part of this gargantuan effort perhaps multiplied his appetite for runs - he has scored six double hundreds including a triple, after scoring his first century in only his fourth Test on a wickedly turning Galle track against New Zealand. </p>
