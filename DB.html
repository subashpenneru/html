              <td colspan="2"></br><p>It was an era, when the fall of the first Australian wicket spelt catastrophe for the bowlers. Celebrations were muted, and voices hushed, in the face of their inevitable doom. The spectators would be clapping, not for the man going off, or the bowler; the applause was one of anticipation.
The Don was coming.</br><b>In a nutshell</b></br>The sport of cricket has seen several good players, and a few rare great players. Some who have achieved numerous moments of glory for their team, and others who have confounded of statisticians and
              romantics alike. None, however, have managed to stretch the imagination and drop jaws like the timeless giant who eclipsed the contemporaries of his domain across generations.
              Once upon a time, more than a century ago, in the small town of Cootamundra, New South Wales, Donald George was born - the man who set such high standards of batting in his time, that the phrase 'second only to The Don' has become a
              part of cricketing jargon. In 52 Test matches over 20 years and a World War, Sir Don Bradman transcended the pinnacle of batsmanship, and then some, to an extent that is deemed insurmountable to this day. He was often revered as a god
              in Australian cricket and went on to form a team that came to be known as the Invincibles. As opposed to the asymptotic greats, The Don was so far beyond the everyday batsman that more than a hundred years on, there isnâ€™t a player who
              has come within an arm's distance of his Test average - Ninety-nine point nine four. </p>
