    <p>Ricky Ponting had all the ingredients of a typical Australian aggressive, vocal and above all, mentally powerful to tackle pressure situations. The best quality about Ponting was his burning desire to win matches and at times, the desperation did bring up infamous incidents but what shone through his career was the sheer desire to be victorious. Three World Cup titles including two consecutive ones as captain to go with a couple of Champions Trophy titles and the no.1 Test ranking shows that he had seen it all in the international arena. Adding to all this was of course his free-wheeling strokeplay as a batsman, amassing runs at will and destroying opposition bowlers. The only title that eluded him was the World T20 but one could argue that the format came around the time that Ponting was in his final years.
    A young and raw Ricky Ponting burst into the international arena in the year 1995 as he debuted in both the formats. He had garnered a big reputation in the domestic circuit for having the ability to produce the big runs and most people were in awe of his skill set. </p>
